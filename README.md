# HIP Duel Engine

### Roadmap

1. New basic mechanism, roughly compatible with old version, but with simpler approach, separate dueling and tournament paths, and more flavor; integrate existing flavor
2. Review the existing targeting code thoroughly
3. Write new flavor
4. Brainstorm methods for increasing the number of duels (generate lowborn fodder to fight sometimes?)
