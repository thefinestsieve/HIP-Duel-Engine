# Ideas:
# Elimination playoff handled through recursive event
# Winners move on, losers knocked out
# Last match winner = 1st place, loser = 2nd place, losers of semifinals get runners up awards
# Eligible characters will be limited to powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, whatever)
# Losers get prestige (maybe a little gold?) awarded in proportion to how many wins they managed to get (if any) before losing
