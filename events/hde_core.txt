# Based loosely on work by Galle (Gregory Hayes) and jordarkelf

### CONTEXT FLAGS
## Duel Type
# flag_duel_friendly
# flag_duel_hostile
## Duel Flavor
# flag_duel_battlefield
# flag_duel_tourney

### MAIN EVENTS
# hde_core.0	Referee decides between FROM and FROMFROM, flags winner and loser, target locks duelists, sends winner first handler event

### HANDLER EVENTS
# These can call different flavor depending on the flavor flags
# hde_core.1	Initial clash handler, randomly chooses from flavored events
# hde_core.2	Combat handler, random flavor events, can be repeated, mid-fight wounding might happen here?
# hde_core.3	Outcome handler, randomly chooses from flavored events

# Outcome types: Loser is outright killed, loser is wounded, loser is subdued. If loser is wounded or subdued, they may be captured, killed, or let go.

# Question: How to handle yield outcomes?? Can the loser choose to fight on?
# Question: How are we going to check for failure states? What if one of the characters dies for some other reason? We'll need a failure event ("You lost track of your opponent in the heat of battle" sort of thing) and we might need to check every step of the way?
# Question: Will we need a safety catch cleanup event?

### FLAVOR EVENTS
# These come in pairs, with winner and loser versions. The winner's version sends event to the loser and triggers the next handler
# These will actually appear in a different file, but for reference purposes:
# x.x	Initial clash flavor
# x.x	Combat flavor
# x.x	Outcome flavor
