############ Regent Flavor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Note when I write flavor here: 1st person, present tense is what I think I'm going with
# Setting: Field outside location at dawn
# Work in location: Someone slips in dewy grass? Briefly blinded by sun?
Lead up stuff happens, then vanilla normally hits you with this:

[Root.Liege.Regent.GetTitledName] has accepted your terms. As dawn breaks, you meet on a field just outside [Root.Location.GetName]. The mist still lies thick on the ground and the brilliance of the early morning sun is reflected in the shining steel of your weapons and armor. It is a good day to die.

So we'll pillage that for our own lead up events. (Unlike the feast duel, I expect less lead up.)

Elements to include in duel: one participant circling so the sun is the other's eyes, one participant screwing up by slipping in the dewy grass, different options triggered by regent status

overall pattern:

initial: challenging courtier wants regency, regent obviously not inclined to acquiesce, keep it short
sizing: circling involved
combat: trying to use sun to advantage, possible slip involved for mistake making party
subdued: knocked down type
wounded/killed: make sure to raid vanilla event text for stuff

output: either regent wins and keeps regency, or courtier wins and takes it, should be flavored differently depending on whether wounded/maimed/spared, etc
